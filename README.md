# Beer_Data_Science_Challenge
---
The Demand Planning Team for Europe BU Central has approached us and asked us for help in analyzing order data and help to build their forecast.

They have provided data on order volume and master data going back to 2018 for us to analyze!

They first want us to conduct an exploratory analysis (since they haven't looked at the data yet) and potentially they will want us to help build their demand forecast.

Your Senior Data Scientist has given you a series of tasks to complete

Your Senior Data Scientist has a couple of guidelines for you to code by which you will be assessed:

If you import any module, specify for what it is going to be used
Do not change the original data sources, perform all the operations on this Jupyter Notebook
If you take assumptions during your analysis, be sure to specify them
Be sure to comment your code so it can be easily read
Make sure there are no errors in the code after handing it in
